# Dice Probability Project

## Overview

This unique project delves into the realm of dice combinations, probabilities, and transformations. It provides a comprehensive set of functionalities to determine the total combinations, showcase the distribution of potential combinations, and calculate probabilities for both standard and modified dice scenarios.

## Features

- **Total Combinations:** Computes the total number of combinations resulting from rolling two dice.
- **Comprehensive Combinations Display:** Generates and showcases a 6x6 matrix illustrating all possible combinations for two six-sided dice.
- **Probability Calculation:** Determines the probabilities associated with each possible sum when rolling two dice.
- **Dice Value Transformation:** Applies a transformation to dice values, leading to the recalculation of probabilities.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone `https://github.com/phoenix1406/Securin.git`

   Use this to clone in your local system to access to both the questions solution 

Solutions are made in C++ for both the question and then its solution approach and logic to the code both are mentioned in the word file (.docx file) given in the repository.
